Sign in with [NEAR] and add a message to the guest book! A starter app built with an [AssemblyScript] backend and a [React] frontend.


Quick Start
===========

To run this project locally:

1. Prerequisites: Make sure you have Node.js ≥ 12 installed (https://nodejs.org), then use it to install [yarn]: `npm install --global yarn` (or just `npm i -g yarn`)
2. Run the local development server: `yarn && yarn dev` (see `package.json` for a
   full list of `scripts` you can run with `yarn`)

Now you'll have a local development environment backed by the NEAR TestNet! Running `yarn dev` will tell you the URL you can visit in your browser to see the app.

**Note for Mac user with M1 chip**: `yarn` will throw an error because the node module **HID** is not ARM64-compliant and needs to be rebuilt, but the `make` failed. This module is optional so this error can be ignored. Just type again `yarn dev` to run the local blockchain backend.

Open in Chrome the URL http://localhost:1234. It displays the GuestBook app's welcome page. Play with it. 

1. Clicking on "Log in" shows a blockchain connection request (as with Ethereum's Metamask). You'll be request to give "limited permission": this is a concept that doesn't exist on Ethereum.
2. When you submit a message without donation, you post a message but don't do any bmockchain transaction.
3. When you submit with donation (the minimum amount is 0.01 NEAR) you'll see that the dApp does a transaction.

That's all. Let's close the browser page and explore the code.


Exploring The Code
==================

1. The backend code lives in the `/assembly` folder. This code gets deployed to
   the NEAR blockchain when you run `yarn deploy:contract`. This sort of
   code-that-runs-on-a-blockchain is called a "smart contract" – [learn more
   about NEAR smart contracts][smart contract docs].
 
2. The frontend code lives in the `/src` folder, like all React frontends. The file
   [`/src/index.html`](/src/index.html) is a great place to start exploring. Note
   that it loads in `/src/index.js`, where you can learn how the frontend
   connects to the NEAR blockchain.
3. Tests: the folder `/assembly/__tests__` contains the test source files. Testing is very important in blockchain programming because once deployed your code is immmutable. There are different kinds of tests for the frontend and backend. The
   backend code gets tested with the [asp] command for running the backend
   AssemblyScript tests, and [jest] for running frontend tests. You can run
   both of these at once with `yarn test`.
4. The folder `neardev` contains the contract account details. Initially it contains only the minimum info. After you deployed the GuestBook app with `yarn dev` it is populated with the credentials of the temporary dev account generated by `yarn dev`.

Both contract and client-side code will auto-reload as you change source files.


Deploy
======

Every smart contract in NEAR has its [own associated account][NEAR accounts]. When you run `yarn dev`, your smart contracts get deployed to the live NEAR TestNet with a throwaway account. When you're ready to make this smart contract permanent, here's how.


Step 0: Install near-cli
--------------------------

You need near-cli installed globally. Here's how:

    npm install --global near-cli

This will give you the `near` [CLI] tool. Ensure that it's installed with:

    near --version


Step 1: Create an account for the contract
------------------------------------------

Visit [NEAR Wallet] and make a new account. You'll be deploying these smart contracts to this new account.

Now authorize NEAR CLI for this new account:

    near login

This command will open the browser page asking permission to connect to the blockchain with your account, as in the Quick Start above, but this time asking for **full permission** . Follow the instructions it gives you.

Step 2: set contract name in code
---------------------------------

Modify the line in `src/config.js` that sets the account name of the contract. Set it to the testnet account id you gave full permission above.

    const CONTRACT_NAME = process.env.CONTRACT_NAME || 'your-account-here!'


Step 3: change remote URL if you cloned this repo 
-------------------------

Unless you forked this repository you will need to change the remote URL to a repo that you have commit access to. This will allow auto deployment to Github Pages from the command line.

1) go to GitHub and create a new repository for this project
2) open your terminal and in the root of this project enter the following:

    $ `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git`


Step 4: deploy!
---------------

One command:

    yarn deploy

As you can see in `package.json`, this does two things:

1. builds & deploys smart contracts to NEAR TestNet
2. builds & deploys frontend code to GitHub using [gh-pages]. This will only work if the project already has a repository set up on GitHub. Feel free to modify the `deploy` script in `package.json` to deploy elsewhere. In my example, the frontend is deployed at the address (Now the backend smart contract is in testnet under my account and the frontend is on github gh-pages: `https://`[your github.io]`/`[your repository name]`/`
